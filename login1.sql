Reutersâ€‹\r\nBut a technology-driven spike in non-OPEC output such as that of US shale and growing fuel efficiency led Riyadh to conclude that the era of fast oil growth might be ending.\r\n \r\nHence, in the past two years Riyadh has stuck to a strategy of fighting for market share, thinking that pumping more oil now at low prices is better than producing less in the future.\r\n \r\nMany OPEC members - apart from Riyadh''s allies in the Gulf, such as Qatar, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates - were unprepared for that shift, with their finances crippled by heavy debts and stagnant production.\r\n \r\nVenezuela and Nigeria pressed Saudi Arabia to agree to price-boosting output cuts, and even Riyadh''s arch-rival Iran is signalling it will be ready for renewed dialogue on freezing production once it reaches pre-sanctions levels.\r\n \r\n"Of course, the issue of the role of OPEC can be raised. Some members want OPEC to play a more significant role in managing the market," said an OPEC delegate from one of the main producing countries in the Middle East. \r\n               ', '293.jpeg'),
